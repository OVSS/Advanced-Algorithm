## Advanced-Algorithm
I will implement algorithms taught in the course [Advanced Algorithm](http://lcbb.epfl.ch/algs16/).

###Amortized Analysis
1. Lefties tree
2. Splay tree
3. Lazy leftist trees

###Competitive analysis
1. LRU cache
2. MTF linklist

###Randomized Analysis
1. Randomized incremental construction: 2D hull
2. Kargerâ€™s randomized mincut algorithm

###Devide and Conque
1. Nearest-neighbor pair
2. Intersection of two convex polygons

###Dynamic Programming
1. Hidden Markov Models
2. Optimal binary search trees

###Iterative Improvement
1. Randomized Stable Marriage
2. Multiplicative Weight Update
